# Preface

Hi, welcome back to the Vert.x Blueprint tutorial series! Nowadays, **microservice architecture** is becoming more and more popular and everyone is willing to have a try with microservice application development.
Very excited, Vert.x provides us a very useful microservice toolbox including **service discovery**, **circuit breaker** and so on.
With the help of Vert.x microservice components, we can establish our microservice application easily.
In this tutorial, we are going to explore a complete online shopping microservice application developed with Vert.x~

What you are going to learn:

- How to develop microservices with Vert.x
- Asynchronous development model
- Reactive and functional pattern
- Event sourcing pattern
- Asynchronous RPC on the clustered event bus
- Various type of services (e.g. HTTP endpoint, message source, data source)
- Service discovery with Vert.x
- How to use Vert.x Circuit Breaker
- How to implement a simple API gateway
- How to manage global authentication using OAuth 2 and Keycloak with Vert.x-Auth

And many more things too...

This is the third part of **Vert.x Blueprint Project**. The entire code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sczyh30/vertx-blueprint-microservice/tree/master).
